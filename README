README for shoehorn-3:
----------------------

Ben Williamson is no longer working on his EP7211 port of Linux 2.2.1,
or on the 'shoehorn' loader he used with it; this version is being
released as 'shoehorn-3' to differentiate it from the older 'shoehorn-2'
distribution.

This version of shoehorn has been modified from the original to support
the following:
	-- Blue Mug's port of kernel 2.4.0 to the EP7211:
	   -- Change kernel load address.
	   -- Change load conventions (no more 'memory fragments').
	   -- More complete usage of param block.
	-- Hardware support for the EDB7211 evaluation board.
	-- Registered ARM kernel architecture number for EDB7211.
	-- Restore serial settings when interrupted.
	-- More diagnostic serial output.
	-- Integrated Joon Suan Ong's very cool patch for Ethernet
	   download, with improved MAC address support by Guenther
	   Leber.
	-- Security fix and other cleanups by Guenther Leber.
	-- RPM and Debian packaging.

The 2.2.1 'calcaria.net' kernel with EP7211 patches is no longer
supported; shoehorn-2 is the right choice for that kernel.

README for shoehorn-2 (kernel boot log omitted):
------------------------------------------------

Latest version: <ftp://ftp.netwinder.org/users/b/benw/ep7211/>

The 7111 and 7211 have internal SRAM and bootstrap ROM.  This package
connects to the device in bootstrap mode over a serial connection, to load
and boot a Linux kernel with ramdisk filesystem.  It's called shoehorn
because I got sick of writing programs called bootstrap.

The piece of code loaded into SRAM (loader.c) knows nothing about the
target hardware, except that it's a 7111 or a 7211 in bootstrap mode.  All
the board-specific initialisation is done by remote control, by the shoehorn
program on the host.  The loader will detect 16 or 32 bit DRAM banks, and
scan for available areas.

At the moment, shoehorn only knows about AppForge's Anvil board.  If you
have other 7111- or 7211- based hardware, you should be able to add support
for it by making a few changes to shoehorn.c.  Ideally there would be a
runtime command-line option to select your board, rather than lots of
#ifdefs.  Send me your patches in whatever state, and I'll try to include
them in the package.  Better yet, send me your hardware and I'll keep it
warm for you.  :)

Any and all success/failure reports, suggestions and complaints are welcome. 
The best place to discuss this stuff at the moment is probably the
linux-7110 mailing list, see <http://www.calcaria.net/> for more info.
