Readme for this PhatBox version:

I have NOT TESTED this, but hope it will work for you.  

The only changes I made to this package were to add in intialization code
specific to the PhatBox, based on the register settings made by the
OEM PhatBox bootloader.

Please let me know if you have any comments -- phatbox at bushing.mm.st
