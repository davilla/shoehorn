	* all: added Debian package support; slightly simplified
	compile-time loader path specification so that it doesn't require
	backslash-escaped double quotes in the path variable.  Will
	release as version 3.2.
	
	* Makefile: Renamed DEFS to EXTRAFLAGS; modified to support
	any combination of command line/Makefile specification of CFLAGS
	and EXTRAFLAGS.

	* all: changes for release 3.0, added copyright notices as
	appropriate.  For older versions, see the README and/or the
	shoehorn-2 tarball.

	* eth.c: port of Joon Suan Ong's ethernet download.
	
	* shoehorn.c: change kernel load address, get rid of kernel-aware
	memory fragmentation stuff for 2.2.1/calcaria.net port, more
	complete param block uses, other tweaks for new kernel image
	format.

	* serial.c: broke serial stuff into its own file; use signal
	handlers to restore serial port and tty to sane state when
	exiting.
